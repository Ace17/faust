These additional tools are provided by various contributors to help 
the building process of applications and plugins with Faust. 

Currently two tools are available :

- faust2sc is a Ruby program used to generate a SuperCollider class 
  file, which can be compiled and subsequently used from within sclang. 

- faust2pd is a Q program used to generate a user interface patch to
  use in conjuction with a Faust generated pd plugin.
